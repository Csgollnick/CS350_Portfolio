# CS350Portfolio



Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In these projects we were required to utilize the CC3220S TI Microcontroller in order to manipulate various functions such as blinking LED's or interacting with sensors.
The final project combined this with interaction via GPIO, UART, and I2C to create a temperature application that shuts the LED off when the temperature is too high.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well with understanding the theory and how the concepts work in theory. I feel confident on how to write a state machine and thnk about how the prject needs
to move and flow in theory.

Where could you improve?
I think my biggest challenge is while I understood the concepts and theories in a close up frame, I never was able to execute them in practice in the vein of a large project.
What I need to do is find open source code of embedded machines and review how they were coded and why they work.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding embedded C, state machines, and basic understanding of how to use and writ for a microcontroller to my repertoire.  

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think the theories of how the programming works (i.e. state machines, Pin interaction, GPIO, etc.) and  the syntax and language of embedded C will be the most transferrable 
information I am taking away.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project is broken up into sections that are clearly notated by comments.  Important lines are commented to indicate areas where quick changes can be made.  This should allow 
the future case to be able to easily locate and isolate areas in the code to make updates or edits.
